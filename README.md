## Synopsis

This Pimcore http://www.pimcore.org plugin installs a set
of sample user avatar images that are automatically used
by the first n users (currently six).

## Code Example / Method of Operation

The sample user default images are copied to the location
where pimcore usually keeps user provided avatars during
plugin installation. It is possible to fork this repository
and just drop in a couple of different PNGs.

## Motivation

The default "robot" images of pimcore are too toy-like. This
plugin contains sample icons that are neutral and professionally
looking. Each one has a distinctive color to tell accounts apart.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.
